  Academy of Danse Libre<br>
  <img alt="danse libre" src="danse libre new small.jpg" style=" height: 189px;"><br>
  Danse Libre, our namesake dance, was created by the students of the Latin Quarter of Paris
  
  
  in the 1840's. With liberated spirits, they took the intricate steps that they had learned as&nbsp;
  
  children in dancing school and "exploded" them into bounds, kicks and extravagant capers.
  The Academy of Danse Libre is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to the lively
  
  of 19th and early 20th century social dances. We aspire to create a vivid picture
  
  
  of the mayhem and joyful passion of the Victorian ballroom, in the spirit of our namesakes.<a
