 <h2>When is  Friday Night Waltz?</h2>
  <br>
  Friday Night Waltz is on ... Fridays! We are usually open about 48 to 52 Fridays a year. Typically the owner of the hall, the First United Methodist Church uses the hall on some Friday nights during the year, preempting our dance. We always give ample notice that we are not using the hall on certain days. 
       <br>
       <br>
       <hr>
       <h2> 
	   <br>

       What is the format of the dance? </h2>
        <br>
        There are 45 to 50 dances 
        in an evening. About half the dances are waltzes, including several kinds of 
        waltzes: <a href="http://socialdance.stanford.edu/syllabi/cross-step_waltz.htm">cross-step waltz</a>, <a
 href="http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3waltz.htm">ballroom</a>, rotary, <a href="http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3vwaltz.htm">viennese</a>, <a href="http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3redow.htm">redowa</a>, 
           hesitation. <br>
        <br>
        Often there are about 6 polkas and about 4 Tangos. <br>
        <br>
        Many of these <a
 href="http://www.centralhome.com/ballroomcountry/polka.htm">polkas</a> are fast. 
           The rest of the dances are the mixers, the choreographed waltzes, one-steps, <a
 href="http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3lindy.htm">swing</a>, <a
 href="http://www.centralhome.com/ballroomcountry/tango.htm">tango</a>, cha-cha, Zweifacher or <a
 href="http://www.centralhome.com/ballroomcountry/salsa.htm">salsa</a> The easier and slower dances are in the half of the dance with faster and harder dances 
           are in the second half.. <br>
        <br>
        At our dances we provide free water and light 
        refreshements, usually blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, 
        seedless grapes, green grapes, carrots, mms, 
        small chocolate cookies, potato 
        chips, trail mix.
           
        If you want
        to get better at these dances, both <span class="style85"><a href="http://www.joanwalton.com" class="style80">Joan Walton</a><span class="style80"> and <a href="http://www.richardpowers.com/">Richard Powers</a> regularly have classes for all the dances we have at Friday Night

      <br>
         <h2>What if I don't know the first thing about waltz?</h2>
         <br>
      Friday Night Waltz offers  newcomer and beginning waltz lessons beginning at 7:15 p.m. Many of the  people who regularly attend Friday Night Waltz are also quite happy to  answer any questions you might have. We all remember what it was like when we were just starting out.
  
      <hr>
  
      <br>
      <h2>What if I don't have a dance partner?      </h2>
            A dance partner isn't  necessary. Partners are rotated while in class, and ballroom dancing is  a venue where men and women are encouraged to ask each other to dance.<br>
      
     <hr>
    <br>
	<h2>How many people come to each dance? </h2>
        It varies. Between one hundred and two hundred people is typical.<br>
        <br>
		           
<hr>

        <h2><br>
        Do you dance anything other than the waltzes?</h2> 
        <br>
      About half of the dance music  we play in an evening is for waltzes ranging from the very slow to the  very fast. Between waltzes, we play polkas, tango, salsa, cha cha, one step, several different line dances like Tokyo polka, the madison, in addition to specialty dances like the Congress of Vienna, cross step mixer, Bohemian National Polka, and Romany Polka.

      <h2>      What should I wear?</h2>
      <br>
    The dress is casual. People wear anything that is comfortable for an evening of energetic dancing.<br>

        <h2><br>
        Dance Descriptions</h2>
        
        
  
        <p><br>
      There are 45  to 50 dances in an evening. Typically, about half the dances are  waltzes, including several kinds of waltzes- cross step, <a href="http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3waltz.htm">ballroom</a>, rotary, <a href="http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3vwaltz.htm">viennese</a>, <a href="http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3redow.htm">redowa</a>,           hesitation. Often there are about 6 polkas.<br>
      <br> 
     Many of these <a href="http://www.centralhome.com/ballroomcountry/polka.htm">polkas</a> are fast and often played to silly music, such as "Constantinople", and  a great instrumental from "Gilligan's Island". <br>
     <br>
     The rest of the dances  are the mixers, the choreographed waltzes, one-steps, <a href="http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3lindy.htm">swing</a>, <a href="http://www.centralhome.com/ballroomcountry/tango.htm">tango</a>, cha-cha and          an occasional  blues dance. <br>
     <br>
The  dance is in 4 sets, with a 1 to 2 minute break between sets, so that  people can take a breather. The easier and slower dances are in the  first two sets, faster and harder dances are in the third and fourth  set. There is usually a mixer in the first and third set, and a  choreographed waltz in the the second and fourth sets. These are not  hard rules, just typical.<br>

Joan Walto and <a href="http://www.richardpowers.com/">Richard Powers</a> regularly have classes for all the dances we have at Friday  Night Waltz. Check out our links page. </p>

          Choreographed dances</h2>
          <br>

   Congress of  Vienna: The Congress of Vienna waltz was choreographed by John Hertz of  Los Angeles (inspired by illustrations in Regency-period dance manuals)  to music that he edited and assembled himself from recordings of three  more-or-less period Swedish waltzes. In addition to being danced at  Friday Night Waltz, the Congress of Vienna is also danced at PEERS,  BAERS, and Gaskell Ball dances. Music for the Congress of Vienna is  available from <a href="http://www.brassworksband.com/">Brassworks</a> and <a href="http://www.well.com/user/cwj/bangersandmash/">Bangers           and Mash</a> Cds.<br>

      <a href="http://socialdance.stanford.edu/syllabi/crosstep.htm">Cross Step Waltz Mixer</a> is a waltz mixer created by  <a href="http://www.richardpowers.com/">Richard Powers</a> and is played at most Friday Night Waltzes.
